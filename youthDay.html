               <h2>16 June 1976</h2>
               <p>Thousands of black youth took to the streets of the (then)Transvaal now known as Gauteng to protest against the regime who had introduced 
                  Afrikaans as the medium of instruction along side English, in black township schools.

               <h2>Arrival of the Police</h2>
               <p>The police was called in to disperse the crowd and as a result the peaceful protest took a turn for the worst.
                  Police arrived on scene with dogs and started using tear gas. When the crowd fought back they started using bullets to control the crowd.

                       <p>Among the first children killed was 15-year-old Hastings Ndlovu, and 12-year-old Hector Pieterson famously depicted
                          in a black and white image of young man holding another who had been injured, carrying him to safety. This picture depicted below 
                          is one of the images synonymous with June 16th and reminds us of the innocent lives lost this day.

                       <p> Although many innocent lives were lost on June 16th, it also symbolises the struggle and the battle we overcame from the oppression.
                           June 16th is a day we will never forget but we can also celebrate to acknowledge our freedom as a democratic country.
